        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.

### Explanation of HTML Components

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**:
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document to be HTML5.

2. **HTML Tag**:
    - `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the HTML document, specifying the language as English.

3. **Head Section**:
    - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
        - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`: Links to the external CSS file for styling.
        - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
        - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the page is responsive by setting the viewport to match the device's width.
        - `<title>Document</title>`: Sets the title of the document.

4. **Body Section**:
    - `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
        - `<h1>CSS</h1>`: A main heading (level 1) for the title of the document.
        - `<p>`: Paragraphs of text providing detailed information about CSS.

5. **Subheadings and Additional Content**:
    - `<h2>Syntax</h2>`: A subheading (level 2) for the syntax section.
    - `<p>`: A paragraph explaining the syntax of CSS.
    - `<h3>Style sheet</h3>`: A subheading (level 3) for the style sheet section.
    - `<p>`: A paragraph explaining what a style sheet consists of.

### Purpose of the Document

This webpage is designed to educate users about CSS, its purpose, syntax, and usage. It includes detailed descriptions of CSS, its benefits, and its role in web development. The structure follows a logical flow, starting with an introduction to CSS and progressing to more specific topics such as syntax and style sheets.

By separating content into different sections and using appropriate headings, the document is easy to read and navigate. The use of an external CSS file (linked in the head section) allows for consistent styling across multiple HTML pages, demonstrating one of the key benefits of using CSS in web development.
