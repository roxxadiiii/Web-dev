    ### Explanation of the HTML Structure

The HTML provided creates a simple webpage with a single heading that displays "NETFLIX". Let's break down the components and understand their roles.

#### HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>NETFLIX</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**
   - Declares the document type and version, which is HTML5 in this case. This helps browsers understand how to render the webpage correctly.

2. **`<html lang="en">`**
   - The root element of the HTML document. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which is English (`en`).

3. **`<head>`**
   - Contains metadata and links to resources such as stylesheets and scripts. This information is not directly displayed on the webpage.

4. **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`**
   - Links an external CSS file named `style.css` to the HTML document. This file contains styles that will be applied to the HTML elements.

5. **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**
   - Sets the character encoding of the document to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters and symbols.

6. **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**
   - Ensures the webpage is responsive by setting the viewport width to the device's width and the initial zoom level to 1.0.

7. **`<title>Document</title>`**
   - Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. The content here is "Document", but it can be changed to a more descriptive title.

8. **`<body>`**
   - Contains the main content of the webpage that will be visible to users.

9. **`<h1>NETFLIX</h1>`**
   - A level 1 heading that displays the text "NETFLIX". This is the main heading on the page and is typically used for the most important heading.

### CSS Styling (style.css)

To style the heading and potentially the entire document, a corresponding `style.css` file can be used. Below is an example of what the CSS might look like to style the heading and body:

#### Example CSS (style.css)

### Final Rendered Page

When the HTML and CSS are combined, the final webpage will have a centered, large, red "NETFLIX" heading on a dark background, styled to resemble the actual Netflix branding. This provides a clean, visually appealing representation with minimal code.
