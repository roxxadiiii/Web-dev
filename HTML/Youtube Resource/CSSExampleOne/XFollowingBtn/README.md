### The Wardrobe of Spells (CSS)

#### The Button's Enchantment (CSS)

-   **`.foll`**: Your spellbook entry for the button. It's not just any button; it's a beacon of connection, with a bold voice and a gentle touch. 📢🔮
    -   **`display: block;`**: It stands alone, a solitary figure, awaiting the touch of the curious.
    -   **`font-weight: bold;`**: Its voice, strong and clear, demanding attention.
    -   **`margin-top: 100px;`**: A lift, so it's not too close to the edge, a respectful distance.
    -   **`width: 85px;`**: Its size, just right, not too big, not too small, perfect for a click.
    -   **`padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;`**: A cushion, making it comfortable to the touch.
    -   **`margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;`**: Centered, as if standing in the heart of the page, awaiting the visitor's gaze.
    -   **`border: 2px solid;`**: A protective charm, outlining its shape with a delicate touch.
    -   **`border-color: #cfd9de;`**: The outline, a soft blue, like the edge of a cloud at dawn.
    -   **`background: white;`**: The surface, pure and inviting, a canvas for the call.
    -   **`border-radius: 18px;`**: Softening the edges, like a river stone smoothed by time.
