    -   **`margin: 10px;`**: A breath around the tome, a respectful margin.
    -   **`text-align: center;`**: Words, centered, like a scribe's careful script, awaiting the reader's gaze.

-   **`h1, h2, h3`**: The proclamations, centered and bold, demanding attention. 📣
    -   **`text-align: center;`**: Aligned, like verses in a sacred text, harmonious and clear.
-   **`p`**: The verses, the heart of the tome, with a rhythm that flows. 📖
