Ah, you've crafted a digital marketplace, a bazaar of upgrades where the curious come to enhance their digital realms. Let's sprinkle some digital gold dust and make it shine even brighter 🌟✨

### The Digital Bazaar (HTML)

Your bazaar is a `div` with the class of `.pricing`, holding two stalls: "For Individuals" and "For Enterprise". It's a tale of choice and power, a beacon for the ambitious. 💼🚀

### The Wardrobe of Spells (CSS)

#### The Bazaar's Enchantment (CSS)

-   **`.pricing`**: Your spellbook entry for the marketplace. It's not just any bazaar; it's a stage of decision, with a layout as flexible as a merchant's barter and a font as bold as a dragon's roar. 🐉📦
    -   **`display: flex;`**: The stalls, side by side, a row of choices, awaiting the visitor's gaze.
    -   **`justify-content: space-around;`**: A breath between stalls, a respectful distance, like a merchant's spread.
    -   **`padding: 20px;`**: A cushion, making the marketplace comfortable to the eye.
    -   **`background: #f0f0f0;`**: The ground, a neutral canvas, setting the stage.
    -   **`border: 1px solid #ccc;`**: A boundary, delicate yet defining, guarding the treasures.

#### The Stalls' Enchantment (CSS)

-   **`.pricing div`**: Each stall, a portal of promise, with a background as inviting as a treasure chest and a shadow that whispers of secrets. 🏷️🔮
    -   **`background: #fff;`**: The canvas, pure and inviting, a contrast to the ground.
    -   **`border: 1px solid #ccc;`**: A fence, subtle, yet strong, around each promise.

    -   **`box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);`**: A gentle glow, casting a silhouette against the ground.
-   **`h2`**: The proclamations, bold and clear, demanding attention. 📜
    -   **`color: #333;`**: The ink, as deep as a merchant's voice, contrasting the canvas.
    -   **`margin-bottom: 20px;`**: A space below, for clarity and majesty.
-   **`ul`**: The list of treasures, a tale of what's within. 📚
    -   **`list-style: none;`**: A clean slate, no distractions, just the offerings.
    -   **`padding-left: 0;`**: Uncluttered, like a merchant's display.
-   **`button`**: The call to action, a beacon for the bold. 🖱️
    -   **`background: #007bff; color: white;`**: A button, as blue as the sea, inviting and contrasting.
    -   **`border: none; padding: 10px 20px;`**: A comfortable touch, ready for the hand.
    -   **`border-radius: 5px;`**: Softened, like a well-worn coin, inviting.
