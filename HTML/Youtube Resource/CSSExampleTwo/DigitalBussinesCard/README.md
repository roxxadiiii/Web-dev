Ah, you've crafted a digital card, a beacon of identity for Aditya Kumar, a frontend wizard from the mystical lands of Bihar, India. Let's sprinkle some digital stardust and make it shine even brighter 🌟✨

### The Digital Card (HTML & CSS)

Your card is a `div` with the class of `.card`, holding a portrait and a tale of skill. It's a tale of code and creation, a beacon for the curious. 🖼️🔮

### The Wardrobe of Spells (CSS)

#### The Card's Enchantment (CSS)
- **`.card`**: Your spellbook entry for the card. It's not just any card; it's a stage of identity, with a background as vibrant as a sunrise and a border as deep as a wizard's cloak. 🌅🧙‍♂️
  - **`padding: 30px;`**: A cushion, making the card comfortable to the eye.
  - **`display: flex;`**: The layout, a river of information, flowing side by side.
  - **`justify-content: space-around;`**: A breath between elements, a respectful distance.
  - **`width: 400px;`**: Its size, just right, a stage for the tale.
  - **`margin: 0px auto;`**: Centered, like a monument, awaiting the visitor's gaze.
  - **`background-color: #83E8BA;`**: The canvas, a hue of growth, setting the mood.
  - **`border-radius: 8px;`**: Softened, like a well-worn tome, inviting touch.
  - **`border-bottom: 10px solid #504136;`**: A foundation, strong and steady, grounding the tale.

#### The Portrait's Enchantment (CSS)
- **`.profile-pic`**: The emblem, a circle of identity, with a border as soft as a whisper and a width that whispers of tales untold. 🖼️🔮
  - **`width: 180px;`**: Its size, perfect for a glance, not too big, not too small, just right.
  - **`border-radius: 10px;`**: Rounded, like a full moon on a special night.
