Ah, you've crafted a mystical garden of emojis, a digital playground where symbols of curiosity and discovery dance under the watchful eye of CSS magic. Let's sprinkle some digital glitter and make it sparkle even more 🌟✨

### The Enchanted Garden (HTML)

Your garden is a `div` with the class of `.container`, holding three magical symbols: a monocle 🥽, a test tube 🧪, and a flask 🧫. It's a tale of exploration and discovery, a beacon for the curious. 🌱🔬

### The Wardrobe of Spells (CSS)

#### The Garden's Enchantment (CSS)
- **`.container`**: Your spellbook entry for the garden. It's not just any garden; it's a canvas of curiosity, with a border as deep as the forest and a height that whispers of tales untold. 🌳📜
  - **`border: 8px solid #016a26;`**: The fence, a protective charm, guarding the garden with a hue as deep as the night.
  - **`height: 260px;`**: Its size, just right, a stage for the symbols to dance.
  - **`display: flex;` and `flex-direction: column;`**: The layout, a river of symbols flowing down, a journey from top to bottom.
  - **`justify-content: start;` and `align-items: center;`**: The arrangement, a gentle start, centered in harmony.

#### The Symbols' Enchantment (CSS)
- **`.item`**: Your spellbook entry for each symbol. They're not just any emojis; they're beacons of knowledge, with a voice as bold as a dragon's roar. 📢🔮
  - **`width: 50px; height: 50px;`**: Their size, perfect for a glance, not too big, not too small, just right.
  - **`margin: 2px;`**: A breath between them, a respectful distance.
  - **`padding: 10px;`**: A cushion, making them comfortable to the eye.
  - **`font-size: 50px;`**: Their voice, loud and clear, demanding attention.
  - **`border: 2px solid black;`**: A protective charm, outlining their shape with a delicate touch.
  - **`background: linear-gradient(#14463d, #016a26);`**: The surface, a gradient from dusk to dawn, a canvas for the call.
