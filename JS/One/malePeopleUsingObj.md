This JavaScript program is designed to process an array of objects, each representing a person with a `firstName` and `gender`. The goal is to identify and print the first names of all males in the array. Below is a detailed explanation of the code, broken down into its components.

### Program Overview

- **Objective**: Print the first names of all male individuals from a given array of person objects.

### Array of Person Objects

- **Name**: `person`
- **Type**: Array
- **Contents**: An array of objects, where each object represents a person with two properties: `firstName` and `gender`.
- **Objects**:
  - Object 1: `{firstName: "Aditya Kumaar", gender: "male"}`
  - Object 2: `{firstName: "Sonal Sharma", gender: "female"}`
  - Object 3: `{firstName: "Ravi Patel", gender: "male"}`
  - Object 4: `{firstName: "Ankita Gupta", gender: "female"}`
  - Object 5: `{firstName: "Vikas Kumar", gender: "male"}`
  - Object 6: `{firstName: "Priya Verma", gender: "female"}`
  - Object 7: `{firstName: "Harish Joshi", gender: "male"}`
  - Object 8: `{firstName: "Shreya Singh", gender: "female"}`
  - Object 9: `{firstName: "Rajesh Yadav", gender: "male"}`
  - Object 10: `{firstName: "Neha Aggarwal", gender: "female"}`

### Loop and Conditional Logic

- **Loop Type**: Traditional `for` loop
- **Initialization**: `let i = 0;` initializes a counter variable `i` to `0`.
- **Condition**: `i < person.length;` checks if `i` is less than the length of the `person` array. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
- **Increment**: `i++` increments `i` by `1` after each iteration.
- **Body**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional statement that checks if the `gender` property of the current object (`person[i]`) is equal to `"male"`. This is done using the loose equality operator (`==`) for type coercion, allowing for both string and possibly other types to be compared.
  - If the condition is true, it constructs a string that combines the `firstName` of the current person object with the string `" is male"` and logs this string to the console.

### Output

- The program will print the first names of all male individuals in the `person` array, each followed by `" is male"`. The output will look something like this:
  ```
  Aditya Kumaar is male
  Ravi Patel is male
  Vikas Kumar is male
  Harish Joshi is male
  Rajesh Yadav is male
  ```

### Conclusion

This script demonstrates basic JavaScript array traversal, conditional logic, and string manipulation. It processes an array of objects to filter and display specific information based on a condition (in this case, identifying male individuals).
