The provided code snippet is a JavaScript program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on a specified operation type. It consists of several functions and a series of function calls to demonstrate these operations. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality in detail.

### Function: `calculateArithmetic`
- **Purpose**: Determines which arithmetic operation to perform based on the `type` parameter and executes the corresponding operation on two numbers, `a` and `b`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The first operand for the arithmetic operation.
  - `b`: The second operand for the arithmetic operation.
  - `type`: A string specifying the type of operation to perform. Possible values are `"sum"`, `"sub"`, `"mul"`, and `"div"`.
- **Process**:
  - Uses conditional statements to check the `type` parameter against predefined operation types.
  - Calls the appropriate arithmetic function based on the `type` value and passes `a` and `b` as arguments.
  - Returns the result of the called arithmetic function.
- **Return Value**: The result of the arithmetic operation.

### Arithmetic Operation Functions
Each of these functions takes two parameters, performs a specific arithmetic operation, and returns the result.

#### Function: `sum`
- **Parameters**: `a`, `b`
- **Operation**: Addition
- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Function: `sub`
- **Parameters**: `a`, `b`
- **Operation**: Subtraction
- **Returns**: The difference of `a` minus `b`.

#### Function: `mul`
- **Parameters**: `a`, `b`
- **Operation**: Multiplication
- **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Function: `div`
- **Parameters**: `a`, `b`
- **Operation**: Division
- **Returns**: The quotient of `a` divided by `b`.

### Main Execution
After defining the `calculateArithmetic` and arithmetic operation functions, the code demonstrates their usage by calling `calculateArithmetic` with different operation types and operands. The results are stored in variables and logged to the console.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Addition Example
- **Function Call**: `calculateArithmetic(6, 4, "sum")`
- **Explanation**: Requests the sum of `6` and `4`.
- **Expected Output**: `10`
- **Console Log**: `"sum is 10"`

#### Subtraction Example
- **Function Call**: `calculateArithmetic(10, 4, "sub")`
- **Explanation**: Requests the difference of `10` and `4`.
- **Expected Output**: `6`
- **Console Log**: `"Sub is 6"`

#### Multiplication Example
- **Function Call**: `calculateArithmetic(33, 4, "mul")`
- **Explanation**: Requests the product of `33` and `4`.
- **Expected Output**: `132`
- **Console Log**: `"Mul is 132"`

#### Division Example
- **Function Call**: `calculateArithmetic(803, 4, "div")`
- **Explanation**: Requests the quotient of `803` divided by `4`.
- **Expected Output**: `200.75`
- **Console Log**: `"div is 200.75"`

### Execution Flow
1. The script defines the `calculateArithmetic` function, which acts as a dispatcher for arithmetic operations.
2. Four helper functions (`sum`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`) are defined to handle specific arithmetic operations.
3. The `calculateArithmetic` function is called multiple times with different parameters to demonstrate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. Results are stored in variables (`valAdd`, `valSub`, `valMul`, `valDiv`) and logged to the console.

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- The code does not explicitly handle invalid `type` values or potential division by zero in the `div` function. If `type` does not match any known operation, `calculateArithmetic` implicitly returns `undefined`. Similarly, dividing by zero in `div` would result in `Infinity` or `-Infinity` depending on the sign of the numerator.

### Best Practices and Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for unknown operation types and division by zero scenarios.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent naming conventions. The operation type `"sum"` could be renamed to `"add"` for consistency with the other operation types (`"sub"`, `"mul"`, `"div"`).
- **Validation**: Validate inputs to ensure they are numbers and handle non-string `type` values gracefully.

### Conclusion
This program demonstrates a simple yet flexible approach to performing arithmetic operations based on runtime input. It showcases basic JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations. By adjusting the `type` parameter, users can dynamically choose the operation to apply to two numbers.
