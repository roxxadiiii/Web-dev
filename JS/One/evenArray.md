Let's break down the provided JavaScript code snippet in detail, focusing on its structure, functionality, and output.

### Code Snippet Analysis

#### Array Declaration

-   **Variable Name**: `array`
-   **Values**: Contains a list of numbers ranging from `1` to `20`, including `0` and skipping `10`.
-   **Type**: Array
-   **Purpose**: To hold a series of numbers for processing.

#### For Loop

-   **Initialization**: `let i = 0;` initializes a counter variable `i` to `0`.
-   **Condition**: `i < array.length;` checks if `i` is less than the length of the `array`. The loop will continue as long as this condition is true.
-   **Increment**: `i++` increments `i` by `1` after each iteration.
-   **Body**: Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current element of the array (`array[i]`) is divisible by `2` with no remainder (`% 2 == 0`). If true, it prints a message to the console indicating that the number is even.

#### Execution Flow

1. The script begins execution from top to bottom.
2. An array named `array` is declared and initialized with a series of numbers.
3. A `for` loop is initiated to iterate over each element in the `array`.
4. For each iteration, the loop checks if the current element is an even number by testing the remainder of division by `2`.
5. If the current element is even, a message is printed to the console stating that the number is even.

### Understanding the Output

-   The output of this script is a series of messages printed to the console, each indicating that a number in the array is even. Specifically, the output will include messages for the numbers `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`, `12`, `14`, `16`, `18`, and `20`.
-   The output will look something like this in the console:
    ```
    2 is even number
    4 is even number
    6 is even number
    8 is even number
    10 is even number
    12 is even number
    14 is even number
    16 is even number
    18 is even number
    20 is even number
    ```

### Conclusion

This script demonstrates how to iterate over an array to perform a specific operation on each element. In this case, it checks each number in the array to determine if it is even and prints a message to the console for each even number found. This example highlights the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.
