Let's dissect the provided JavaScript code snippet, focusing on its structure, functionality, and output.

### Code Snippet Analysis

#### Variable Declarations
- **Variable Name**: `firstName`
- **Value**: `"Aaditya"`
- **Type**: String
- **Purpose**: Stores the first name of a person.

- **Variable Name**: `lastName`
- **Value**: `"Kumar"`
- **Type**: String
- **Purpose**: Stores the last name of a person.

#### Console Log Statement
- **Functionality**: The `console.log()` function is used to print messages to the web console. It's a common way to debug or display information in development environments.
- **Message Construction**: The message string `"hey GOOD MORNING "` is concatenated with the values of `firstName` and `lastName` variables using the `+` operator. This results in a personalized greeting message.
- **Output**: When executed, this line prints the following message to the console:
  ```
  hey GOOD MORNING Aaditya Kumar
  ```

#### Execution Flow
1. The script begins execution from top to bottom.
2. Two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, are declared and assigned string values.
3. A single statement uses `console.log()` to concatenate these variables into a greeting message and outputs it to the console.

### Understanding the Output
- The output of this script is a greeting message that includes the first and last names of a person. In this case, the output will always be:
  ```
  hey GOOD MORNING Aaditya Kumar
  ```
- Since the values of `firstName` and `lastName` are hardcoded, the output does not change unless the values of these variables are modified.

### Conclusion
This script is a straightforward example of using variables and the `console.log()` function to create and display a personalized greeting message. It demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax and operations, including variable declaration, string concatenation, and outputting text to the console.
