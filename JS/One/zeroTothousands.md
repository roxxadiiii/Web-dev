Let's analyze the provided JavaScript code snippet in detail, focusing on its structure, functionality, and output.

### Code Snippet Analysis

#### For Loop
- **Initialization**: `let i = 0;` initializes a counter variable `i` to `0`.
- **Condition**: `i <= 1000;` checks if `i` is less than or equal to `1000`. The loop will continue as long as this condition is true.
- **Increment**: `i++` increments `i` by `1` after each iteration.
- **Body**: Inside the loop, `console.log(i);` prints the current value of `i` to the console.

#### Execution Flow
1. The script begins execution from top to bottom.
2. A `for` loop is initiated with the initial value of `i` set to `0`.
3. As long as `i` is less than or equal to `1000`, the loop executes. On each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.
4. Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is logged to the console.

### Understanding the Output
- The output of this script is a sequence of numbers from `0` to `1000`, each printed on a new line in the console. This is because the loop iterates 1001 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 1000`), and on each iteration, it prints the current value of `i`.
- The sequence will look like this in the console:
  ```
  0
  1
  2
 ...
  998
  999
  1000
  ```

### Conclusion
This script is a simple demonstration of using a `for` loop to generate and print a sequence of numbers. It highlights the basics of loop control structures in JavaScript, specifically the initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement steps that define the loop's behavior.
